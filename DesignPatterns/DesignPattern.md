# Software Design Pattern

* According to Wikipedia - A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
	
* Classification and List
  * Creational Patterns.
  * Structural Patterns.
  * Behavioral Patterns.
  * Concurrency Patterns.
	
* Why do we need software design pattern?
    a. The most important concern which we often neglect is that you should be able to easily change anything later.
    b. What we developed today could be irrelevant tomorrow.
    c. And our code should be flexible enough so that it is not too costly to change.
    d. Patterns are best practices to cover such attributes.
		
* What is Not Design Pattern?
    * It is not code reuse, as it usually does not specify code. The actual implementation depends on the programming language and even the person that is doing it.
    * Design Pattern and Principle (SOLID) are two different things.
    * It is neither a solution nor is it an algorithm.
    * Software Architecture is not a design pattern.
       * Software architecture dictates what's going to be implemented and where it will be put.
        * While design pattern states how it should be done.
* Before diving into the design patters, we should learn some basic design principles called SOLID.
    * SRP - Single Responsibility Principle.
    * OCP - Open / Closed Principle.
    * LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle.
    * ISP - Interface Segregation Principle.
    * DIP - Dependancy Inversion Principle.
